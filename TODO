BEFORE REDIS 1.0.0-rc1

- TTL command that returns -1 if a key is not volatile otherwise the time to live of a volatile key.
- Remove max number of args limit
- What happens if the saving child gets killed or segfaults instead of ending normally? Handle this.
- Make sinterstore / unionstore / sdiffstore returning the cardinality of the resulting set.
- maxclients directive
- check 'server.dirty' everywere
- replication automated tests
- Shutdown must kill other background savings before to start saving. Otherwise the DB can get replaced by the child that rename(2) after the parent for some reason.
- Document replication
- Objects sharing configuration, add the directive "objectsharingpool <size>"
- Make sure to convert all the fstat() calls to 64bit versions.
- SINTERCOUNT, SUNIONCOUNT, SDIFFCOUNT

AFTER 1.0 stable release

- Use partial qsort for SORT + LIMIT
- Locking primitives

FUTURE HINTS

- In memory compression: if in-memory values compression will be implemented, make sure to implement this so that addReply() is able to handle compressed objects, just creating an uncompressed version on the fly and adding this to the output queue instead of the original one. When insetad we need to look at the object string value (SORT BY for example), call a function that will turn the object into an uncompresed one.
